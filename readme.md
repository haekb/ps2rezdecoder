# PS2 Rez Decoder and Extractor
Extracts PS2 lithtech rez files. That's about it.

The rez only contains hashes, so if you're missing a specific file, you can add it into the file list. The application will hash that filename/path and check it against the hashes in the rez file. If it matches, it'll extract it for you!
